# active_oberon

This is the start of a multi language compiler for the Oberon fammily. A single compiler will be able to compile sourcecode for Oberon, Oberon-2 and ActiveOberon. Starting with a parser for the latter one at fisrt.

This compiler written in Rust will be able to execute under Linux, Windows and Mac and generate code for X86-64 and ARM V8.2, even in cross compiler mode and with projects with sourcecode in different dialects of Oberon generating a single executable file.

The rest of the system, utillities and libraries will be entirely written in ActiveOberon and will be stage two of building from git repository.

Project has just started and will not be usefull for much until compiler is more done.
